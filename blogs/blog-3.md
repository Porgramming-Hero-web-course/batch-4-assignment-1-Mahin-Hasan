## Why are Type Guards Necessary? Discuss Various Types of Type Guards and Their Use Cases.

- Using type guard we can explicitly declare the type of value we are storing to the variable and passing to the funcitons
- We can control the behaviour of a function based on type of value passed as parameters
- By using type guards we can ensure no other than the type declared is assigned which can help to minimize errors that will encounter in production grade applications
